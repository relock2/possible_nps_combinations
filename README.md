# Return All Possible NPS Combinations for a Given Population

The create_nps_pop.R function creates a random population of a given size with a given Net Promoter Score (NPS). However, what if we wanted to know every possible combination of promoters, passives, and detractors that could result in the same NPS for a given population? This could be used to deliberately select very different combinations of the same NPS for testing (e.g. to test the coverage of the adjusted Wald confidence interval), or to illustrate the wide variety of populations that could be represented by the same NPS.
